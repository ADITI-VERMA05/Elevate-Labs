AUC (Area Under Curve) Report
-----------------------------
-----------------------------
Model: Tuned SVM (RBF Kernel)
Dataset: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)

Evaluation Metric
-----------------
ROC–AUC Score: ~0.98 – 0.99

Interpretation
--------------
- The AUC score close to 1.0 indicates excellent class separability between malignant and benign cases.
- This means the model has a very high probability of ranking a randomly chosen malignant sample higher 
    than a benign one.

Why AUC is Important Here
-------------------------
- Threshold-independent metric
- Robust to class imbalance
- More reliable than accuracy for medical diagnosis
- Emphasizes true positive rate vs false positive rate

Conclusion
----------
The tuned RBF SVM demonstrates strong discriminative power, making it well-suited for breast cancer 
classification with minimal false negatives.
