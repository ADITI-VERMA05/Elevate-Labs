Interview Questions
-------------------
-------------------
1. What is margin in SVM?
----------------------
Margin is the distance between the decision boundary (hyperplane) and the closest 
data points from each class.
- These closest points are called support vectors.
- SVM’s main goal is to maximize the margin.

2. Difference between Linear Kernel and RBF Kernel?
--------------------------------------------------
Linear kernel works for linearly separable data, while RBF kernel handles non-linear 
relationships by mapping data to higher dimensions.

3. What is C parameter?
-----------------------
C is the regularization parameter that controls the trade-off between:
Maximizing margin
Minimizing classification error
Effects:
- Small C → Larger margin, allows misclassification (more bias)
- Large C → Smaller margin, strict classification (more variance)

4. What is gamma?
-----------------
Gamma defines how far the influence of a single training point reaches.
Effects:
- Low gamma → Far influence → smoother decision boundary
- High gamma → Near influence → complex boundary (overfitting risk)

5. Why scaling required for SVM?
--------------------------------
SVM relies on distance calculations.
If features are on different scales:
- Large-scale features dominate
- Model becomes biased
Benefits of scaling:
- Faster convergence
- Better margin calculation
- Prevents dominance of one feature
