1. Why Logistic Regression is used for classification?
------------------------------------------------------
Logistic Regression is used for classification because it predicts the probability of a class using a sigmoid function 
and then maps it to discrete classes (0 or 1).
It works well for binary classification, is easy to interpret, and performs efficiently on linearly separable data.

2. What is precision and recall?
--------------------------------
Precision tells us how many predicted positives are actually correct.
ie. “Out of all predicted positive cases, how many were truly positive?”
Recall tells us how many actual positives were correctly predicted.
ie. “Out of all actual positive cases, how many did we find?”
Precision focuses on false positives, while recall focuses on false negatives.

3. What is ROC curve?
---------------------
The ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve is a graph that shows the trade-off between:
>> True Positive Rate (Recall)
>> False Positive Rate
It helps evaluate how well a classification model separates classes at different thresholds.

4. What does AUC mean?
----------------------
AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) measures the overall performance of the model.
>> AUC = 1 → Perfect classifier
>> AUC = 0.5 → Random guessing
Higher AUC means the model is better at distinguishing between classes.

5. What is confusion matrix?
----------------------------
A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes model predictions by comparing:
Actual values vs Predicted values
It contains:
>> True Positives (TP)
>> True Negatives (TN)
>> False Positives (FP)
>> False Negatives (FN)
It helps calculate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
