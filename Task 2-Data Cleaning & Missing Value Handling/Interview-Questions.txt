1️. Mean vs Median Imputation?
Mean imputation replaces missing values with the average and is sensitive to outliers, while median imputation uses the middle value and 
is robust to outliers.

2️. When should rows be dropped?
Rows should be dropped when missing values are very few or when they do not contain important information for modeling.

3️. Why is missing data harmful?
Missing data can bias the model, reduce accuracy, and lead to incorrect conclusions if not handled properly.

4️. What is data leakage?
Data leakage occurs when information from outside the training data is used during model training, leading to unrealistically high 
performance.

5️. What is data quality?
Data quality refers to how accurate, complete, consistent, and reliable the data is for analysis and modeling.
