MODEL EVALUATION REPORT
-----------------------

Model Used:
Optimized Linear Regression (with preprocessing and regularization)

Dataset:
California Housing Dataset

Evaluation Metrics:
-------------------

1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE):
   MAE = 50702.17

   Interpretation:
   On average, the model’s predictions differ from the actual house prices by approximately 50,702 units.

2. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE):
   RMSE = 70031.49

   Interpretation:
   RMSE penalizes larger errors more than MAE. The value indicates that large prediction errors exist but are 
   within an acceptable range for housing price prediction.

Overall Conclusion:
-------------------
The optimized linear regression model shows reasonable predictive performance. RMSE being higher than MAE indicates 
the presence of some outliers, which is expected in real-world housing datasets. The model generalizes well and is 
suitable as a baseline regression model.
