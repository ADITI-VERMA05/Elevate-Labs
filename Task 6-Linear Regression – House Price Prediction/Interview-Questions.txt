**Interview Questions**
-----------------------
-----------------------
1. What is the use of Linear Regression?
----------------------------------------
Linear Regression is used to predict a continuous numerical value by finding the relationship between input features and an output variable.
It helps understand how changes in inputs affect the output.

2. What is RMSE and why is it important?
----------------------------------------
RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) measures the average magnitude of prediction errors.
It is important because it penalizes large errors and shows how close predictions are to actual values.

3. Why do we split train and test data?
---------------------------------------
Training data is used to learn the model, while test data is used to evaluate its performance on unseen data.
This helps check generalization and avoid overfitting.

4. What does a coefficient represent?
-------------------------------------
A coefficient shows how much the target variable changes when a feature increases by one unit.
It also indicates the direction (positive or negative) of the relationship.

5. What is underfitting?
------------------------
Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the data pattern.
It performs poorly on both training and test data.
