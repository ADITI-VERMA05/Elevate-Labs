1. What is Overfitting?
-----------------------
Overfitting happens when a model learns the training data too well, including noise and unnecessary details.
As a result, it performs very well on training data but poorly on new or unseen data.

2. Accuracy vs Precision
------------------------
Accuracy tells us how many predictions were correct overall.
Precision tells us how many of the predicted positives were actually correct.

3. What is Recall?
------------------
Recall measures how many actual positives the model was able to identify correctly.

4. What is a Confusion Matrix?
------------------------------
A confusion matrix is a table used to evaluate model performance.
It shows:
True Positives
True Negatives
False Positives
False Negatives

5. Why Do We Split Data?
------------------------
We split data into training and testing sets to check how well the model works on new, unseen data.
