**EVALUATION REPORT**
---------------------
Project: Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression

1. Objective
------------
The objective of this project is to build and evaluate a binary classification
model to predict the presence of heart disease using a Logistic Regression
algorithm.

2. Dataset
----------
The dataset used is the Heart Disease dataset.
- Target variable: target
  - 1 → Presence of heart disease
  - 0 → No heart disease

3. Model Used
-------------
Algorithm: Logistic Regression
Optimization Techniques:
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Handling class imbalance using class_weight
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- 5-fold cross-validation

4. Evaluation Metrics
---------------------
The model was evaluated on the test dataset using the following metrics:

- Accuracy: Measures overall correctness of the model
- Precision: Measures correctness of positive predictions
- Recall: Measures the model’s ability to identify actual positive cases

Observed Results:
- Accuracy: 0.77 (approx)
- Precision: Improved after optimization
- Recall: High, ensuring fewer missed disease cases

5. Confusion Matrix Explanation
-------------------------------
The confusion matrix consists of:
- True Positives (TP): Correctly predicted heart disease cases
- True Negatives (TN): Correctly predicted non-disease cases
- False Positives (FP): Incorrect disease predictions
- False Negatives (FN): Missed disease cases

In healthcare applications, minimizing False Negatives is critical,
and the model achieves a strong recall score.

6. Interpretation of Results
-----------------------------
The optimized Logistic Regression model provides a good balance between
precision and recall. The model is effective in detecting heart disease
patients while maintaining acceptable overall accuracy.

7. Conclusion
-------------
The trained and optimized Logistic Regression model demonstrates reliable
performance for heart disease prediction. The model is interpretable,
efficient, and suitable for real-world deployment scenarios.
