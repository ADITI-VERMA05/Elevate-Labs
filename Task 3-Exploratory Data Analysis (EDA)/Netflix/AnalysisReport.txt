VISUAL INSIGHTS REPORT – NETFLIX MOVIES AND TV SHOWS DATASET
===========================================================

1. DISTRIBUTION OF NUMERICAL FEATURES (HISTOGRAMS)
-------------------------------------------------
Histograms of numerical features such as release year and duration (converted to
numeric form) show that most Netflix content has been released in recent years,
especially after 2015. This indicates a rapid growth in content production on the
platform in the last decade.

2. CATEGORICAL FEATURE ANALYSIS (COUNT PLOTS)
---------------------------------------------
Count plots of categorical features reveal that Movies dominate the Netflix catalog
compared to TV Shows. Ratings such as TV-MA and TV-14 appear most frequently, and a
small number of countries contribute the majority of content, highlighting geographic
concentration.

3. OUTLIER DETECTION (BOX PLOTS)
--------------------------------
Box plots of duration show the presence of outliers, particularly very long movies and
TV shows with a high number of seasons. These outliers represent special cases such as
extended films or long-running series.

4. CORRELATION ANALYSIS (HEATMAP)
---------------------------------
The correlation heatmap between numerical features such as release year and numeric
duration shows a weak correlation. This indicates that the length of content is not
strongly dependent on its release year.

5. KEY INSIGHTS FROM VISUALIZATIONS
----------------------------------
- Netflix content production has increased significantly in recent years.
- Movies are more common than TV Shows on the platform.
- Content duration varies widely across titles.
- Most numerical features show weak correlation with each other.

6. IMPORTANT FEATURES FOR PREDICTION
------------------------------------
Depending on the prediction task, important features include:
- Type (Movie or TV Show)
- Release Year
- Rating
- Duration (numeric)
- Country

7. SUMMARY
----------
- The dataset contains mixed data types including numerical, categorical, and text
  features.
- Categorical features dominate the dataset.
- The dataset is suitable for recommendation systems and trend analysis.
- Categorical encoding and text preprocessing are required before machine learning
  modeling.

CONCLUSION
----------
The Netflix dataset provides valuable insights into content trends and user
preferences. After appropriate preprocessing, it is well-suited for exploratory
analysis, recommendation systems, and machine learning applications.
