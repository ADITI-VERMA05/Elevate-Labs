1. What is EDA?
---------------
EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) is the process of understanding data using statistics and visualizations.
It helps identify patterns, trends, and data quality issues before modeling.

2. What is correlation?
-----------------------
Correlation measures the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables.
It helps understand how changes in one feature affect another.

3. Why detect outliers?
-----------------------
Outliers can distort statistical measures and negatively impact model performance.
Detecting them improves data reliability and prediction accuracy.

4. What is multicollinearity?
-----------------------------
Multicollinearity occurs when independent variables are highly correlated with each other.
It can make model coefficients unstable and hard to interpret.

5. Why is visualization important?
----------------------------------
Visualization makes complex data easy to understand at a glance.
It reveals patterns, relationships, and anomalies that numbers alone may miss.
