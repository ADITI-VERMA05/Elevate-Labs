Interview Questions
-------------------
-------------------
1. What are Hyperparameters?
----------------------------
Hyperparameters are configuration settings that are set before training a machine learning model.
They are not learned from data — instead, they control how the model learns.

2️. Why is GridSearchCV Used?
----------------------------
GridSearchCV from scikit-learn is used to:
- Find the best combination of hyperparameters
- Avoid manual trial-and-error
- Use cross-validation for reliable evaluation
How it works:
- Define a parameter grid
- Train model for every possible combination
- Perform cross-validation
- Select best-performing combination

3️. What is Cross-Validation?
----------------------------
Cross-validation (CV) is a technique to evaluate model performance more reliably.
Most common: K-Fold Cross Validation
🔹 K-Fold Process:
- Split data into K equal parts (e.g., 5)
- Train on K-1 folds
- Test on remaining fold
- Repeat K times
- Take average score
Why use it?
- Reduces overfitting
- Uses full dataset efficiently
- Gives stable performance estimate
GridSearchCV uses cross-validation internally.

4️. Why is Tuning on Test Data Wrong?
------------------------------------
Test data must be kept completely unseen.
If you tune hyperparameters using test data:
- Model indirectly “learns” from test set
- You get biased performance
- Real-world performance will drop
- It causes data leakage
Test data should simulate real-world unseen data.

5️. GridSearch vs RandomSearch?
------------------------------
Both are hyperparameter tuning techniques in scikit-learn.

| Feature     | GridSearchCV          | RandomizedSearchCV    |
| ----------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| Search Type | Exhaustive            | Random sampling       |
| Speed       | Slower                | Faster                |
| Best for    | Small parameter space | Large parameter space |
| Accuracy    | May find optimal      | May find near-optimal |

GridSearch:
- Tries all combinations
- More computationally expensive
RandomSearch:
- Tries random combinations
- Efficient for large models
