Interview Questions
-------------------
-------------------
1. What problem does PCA solve?
-------------------------------
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) solves the problem of high dimensionality in datasets.
When a dataset has many correlated features:
- Models become slower
- Risk of overfitting increases
- Visualization becomes difficult
- Redundant information exists
PCA:
- Reduces dimensions while retaining maximum information
- Converts correlated features into uncorrelated principal components
- Keeps the directions of maximum variance

2. What is explained variance?
------------------------------
Explained variance tells us how much information (variance) each principal 
component captures from the original data.
Each principal component has an explained variance ratio
- It indicates the percentage of total variance retained
Example:
- PC1 → 60% variance
- PC2 → 25% variance
- PC3 → 10%
Cumulative explained variance:
- PC1 + PC2 = 85% information retained

3. Why is scaling required for PCA?
-----------------------------------
PCA is distance and variance-based.
If features are on different scales:
- High-magnitude features dominate
- PCA becomes biased toward those features
Example:
- Income (₹ in thousands)
- Age (years)
Without scaling:
- Income dominates principal components
With scaling (StandardScaler):
- All features contribute equally

4. PCA vs feature selection?
----------------------------
| Aspect               | PCA                           | Feature Selection      |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Type                 | Feature **extraction**        | Feature **selection**  |
| Output               | New components                | Original features      |
| Interpretability     | Low                           | High                   |
| Correlation handling | Yes                           | Depends on method      |
| Use case             | Compression & noise reduction | Model interpretability |

5. What are PCA limitations?
----------------------------
1. Loss of interpretability
- Principal components don’t have physical meaning
2. Linear method only
- Cannot capture non-linear relationships
3. Sensitive to scaling
- Requires proper normalization
4. Information loss
- Some variance is always discarded
5. Not ideal for supervised tasks
- Does not consider target variable
