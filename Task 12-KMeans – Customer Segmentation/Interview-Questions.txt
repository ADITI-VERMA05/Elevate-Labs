Interview Questions
-------------------
-------------------
1. What is clustering?
----------------------
Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to group similar data points 
together without predefined labels.
- Objects in the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters
- Used when we don’t know target classes in advance

2. Why scaling matters in KMeans?
---------------------------------
KMeans uses distance-based calculations (Euclidean distance) to form clusters.
If features are on different scales:
- Features with larger values dominate
- Clusters become biased and incorrect

3. What is inertia?
-------------------
Inertia is the sum of squared distances of each data point from its nearest cluster centroid.
- Measures how compact the clusters are.
- Lower inertia → tighter clusters.
Mathematically:
-> Inertia = Σ (distance of point to centroid)²

4. What is the Elbow Method?
----------------------------
The Elbow Method helps determine the optimal number of clusters (K).
Steps:
1. Run KMeans for multiple values of K
2. Compute inertia for each K
3. Plot K vs Inertia
4. Look for the “elbow point” where the decrease slows

5. What are the limitations of KMeans?
--------------------------------------
KMeans is fast and simple, but has important drawbacks:
>> Limitations:
- Need to specify K in advance
- Sensitive to initial centroid placement
- Sensitive to outliers
- Assumes spherical clusters
- Performs poorly with non-linear or overlapping clusters
- Works best with numerical data only
