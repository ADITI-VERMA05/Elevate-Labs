Interview Questions
-------------------
-------------------

Why do Decision Trees overfit?
------------------------------
Decision Trees overfit because they keep splitting until they perfectly fit training data, capturing noise 
instead of patterns.

What is max_depth?
------------------
max_depth limits how deep the tree can grow.
✔ Smaller depth → less overfitting
✔ Larger depth → more complex model

What is Gini Impurity?
----------------------
Gini Impurity measures how mixed the classes are in a node.
Gini = 0 → pure node
Lower Gini → better split

What is pruning?
------------------
Pruning removes unnecessary branches from a decision tree to:

Reduce overfitting
Improve generalization
Make the tree simpler

What is a decision boundary?
---------------------------
A decision boundary is the rule-based region where the model decides between classes.
In Decision Trees, boundaries are axis-aligned splits (if-else rules).
