🔹 Metric Interpretation
-------------------------
>> Accuracy (~79%): 
- The model correctly predicts customer subscription behavior for most cases.
>> Precision (~0.72):
- When the model predicts a customer will subscribe, it is correct most of the time.
- Important to avoid targeting uninterested customers.
>> Recall (~0.63):
- The model identifies a good portion of actual subscribers.
- Some potential subscribers are missed, which is acceptable in marketing trade-offs.
>> F1-Score
- Balanced measure of precision and recall.
- Indicates stable and reliable performance.

🔹 Overfitting Check
---------------------
Dataset	Accuracy
- Training ~79%
- Testing  ~79%
