1️. Difference between numerical and categorical data?
Numerical data represents measurable quantities like age or score, while categorical data represents 
labels or groups like gender or city.

2️. What is a target variable?
The target variable is the output that a machine learning model is trained to predict.

3️. Why is data understanding important before modeling?
Understanding data helps identify issues like missing values, imbalance, and feature types, ensuring 
correct model selection and better results.

4️. What is data imbalance?
Data imbalance occurs when one class has significantly more samples than others, which can bias the 
model’s predictions.

5️. What does df.describe() show?
df.describe() provides statistical summaries such as mean, minimum, maximum, and percentiles for 
numerical features.
