1. Label Encoding vs One-Hot Encoding?
--------------------------------------
Label encoding assigns numeric labels to categories, while one-hot encoding creates separate binary columns.
One-hot encoding avoids false ordinal relationships between categories.

2. Why is scaling required?
---------------------------
Scaling ensures all features contribute equally to model training.
It prevents features with larger values from dominating distance-based algorithms.

3. What is normalization?
-------------------------
Normalization scales data to a fixed range, usually between 0 and 1.
It improves model stability and convergence speed.

4. Which algorithms need scaling?
---------------------------------
Distance-based and gradient-based algorithms like KNN, SVM, K-Means, and Linear Regression require scaling.
Tree-based models generally do not require scaling.

5. What is feature engineering?
-------------------------------
Feature engineering is the process of creating or transforming variables to improve model performance.
It helps models learn patterns more effectively.ionships, and anomalies that numbers alone may miss.
