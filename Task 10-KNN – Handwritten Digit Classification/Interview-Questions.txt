Interview Questions
-------------------
-------------------
1. What is K in KNN?
--------------------
K is the number of nearest neighbors considered to classify a new data point.
In handwritten digit classification:
- If K = 3, the model looks at the 3 closest digit images
- The digit with majority votes becomes the predicted label

2. Why is scaling required for KNN?
-----------------------------------
KNN uses distance-based calculations, so features with larger values dominate.
In digit images:
- Pixel values range from 0 to 255
- If not scaled, brighter pixels unfairly influence distance
✔ Scaling ensures:
- All pixels contribute equally
- Distance calculations are meaningful
Common scaling:
- StandardScaler
- MinMaxScaler

3. What is Euclidean distance?
------------------------------
It measures the straight-line distance between two points in feature space.
In digit classification:
- Each image is a point in high-dimensional space (e.g., 784 pixels)
- Euclidean distance compares visual similarity between digits

4. What happens if K is too low?
--------------------------------
If K is very small (e.g., K = 1):
- Model becomes very sensitive to noise
- High variance → overfitting

5. What are the limitations of KNN?
-----------------------------------
- Slow prediction – computes distance with all training samples
- High memory usage – stores entire dataset
- Sensitive to noise & outliers
- Performance degrades in high dimensions (curse of dimensionality)
- Needs feature scaling
