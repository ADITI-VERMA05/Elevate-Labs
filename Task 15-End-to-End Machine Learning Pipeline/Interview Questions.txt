Interview Questions
-------------------
-------------------
1. What is an ML Pipeline?
--------------------------
An ML Pipeline is a structured sequence of steps that automates the machine learning workflow — from data preprocessing 
to model training and prediction.
It combines:
- Data preprocessing (scaling, encoding, imputation)
- Feature engineering
- Model training
- Evaluation
    into a single reusable object.

2️. Why do pipelines reduce data leakage?
----------------------------------------
> What is Data Leakage?
Data leakage happens when information from the test set accidentally influences training.
The pipeline:
- Fits scaler only on training data
- Applies same transformation to test data using .transform()
So:
- No future/test information leaks into training
- Safe cross-validation

3️. What is ColumnTransformer?
-----------------------------
ColumnTransformer allows you to apply different preprocessing to different columns.
This:
- Applies scaling only to numeric columns
- Applies encoding only to categorical columns
- Combines everything into one feature matrix

4️. Why do pipelines help in deployment?
---------------------------------------
Pipelines are deployment-friendly because:

1. Everything is inside one object
Instead of saving:
- scaler.pkl
- encoder.pkl
- model.pkl
2. Same preprocessing in production
When user sends new data:
It automatically:
- Scales
- Encodes
- Applies model
No mismatch.
3. Cleaner integration in APIs
Very useful in:
- Flask
- FastAPI
- Streamlit
- AWS / GCP deployment

5️. Pipeline vs Manual Preprocessing?
------------------------------------
| Aspect            | Manual Preprocessing | Pipeline   |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ---------- |
| Code Structure    | Scattered            | Structured |
| Data Leakage Risk | High                 | Low        |
| Cross Validation  | Difficult            | Easy       |
| Deployment        | Complicated          | Simple     |
| Maintainability   | Hard                 | Clean      |
